The attached zip file contains nine files. The most important is ```Assignment2-Student.ipynb```. This contains the full assignment, including all questions. You will also need the set of seven data files,  `part1_train.csv`, `part1_test.csv`, `1.2_fold0.csv`, `1.2_fold1.csv`, `1.2_fold2.csv`, `1.2_fold3.csv`,  and `1.2_fold4.csv`, which you will need for part 1. Finally, the attached PDF simply repeats the questions asked in the jupyter notebook, and tells you how many points each question is worth.

Grading notes:
- For 474, the points here add up to 90. 
- For 575, the points here add up to 100. 

Submission notes:
- Submissions will be through the group submission portal on UBLearns. We still do not know your groups, so we will set this up once those are finalized.
- You will submit four things: 1) an ```.ipynb``` file containing your solution code, 2) a PDF with your answers to the questions asked, and 3/4) two data files that the assignment requests you provide.

Any further details will be provided on Piazza.
