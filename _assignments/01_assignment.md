The attached zip file contains four files. The most important is ```assignment_1_474_s22.ipynb```. This contains the full assignment, including all questions. You will also need the two images (which give details on how to access the reddit API), as well as the csv ```part2_data.csv```, which you will need for parts 2 and 3 (despite the name). The attached PDF simply repeats the questions asked in the jupyter notebook, and tells you how many points each question is worth.

Grading notes:
- For 474, the points here add up to 75. The remaining 25 will be based on code spot checks.
- For 575, the points here add up to 90. The spot checks will be worth 30 points, and we will then normalize your score out of 120 to get a final grade out of 100.

Submission notes:
- Submissions will be through the group submission portal on UBLearns. We still do not know your groups, so we will set this up once those are finalized.
- You will submit three things: 1) a ```.ipynb``` file containing your solution code, 2) a PDF with your answers to the questions asked, and 3) a data file that the assignment requests you provide.

Any further details will be provided on Piazza.
