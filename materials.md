## Intro stuff

I will cover content from some of these in the first two weeks of lecture, but these materials are handy if you want to brush up on the fundamentals.

### Probability and Stats
- [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html)
- [Khan Academy open AP Stats Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)
- [CMU's ML course, math primer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/slides/10601-math-resources.pdf)

### Linear Algebra
- [The matrix calculus you need for deep learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html)
- [Three Blue One Brown Course on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) 

### Python programming
- [The official python3 tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [Sebastian Raschka's notebook on intro to scientific computing](https://github.com/rasbt/stat451-machine-learning-fs20/blob/master/L04/04_scipython__code.ipynb)
- [Minitorch, to help understand deep learning tools we will use later in the semester](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch)


## Books

There is no required course textbook. However, I will at times suggest readings from  [Hal Daum√© III Course in Machine Learning Book](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-all.pdf).

And, some other (free online) books that you may find useful, and/or that we may refer to at some point in the class (oriented, given my expertise, to probabilistic/statistical perspectives):
- [Bayesian Data Analysis Third edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf)
- [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf)
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)
- [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)
- [Statistical Learning with Sparsity](https://hastie.su.domains/StatLearnSparsity_files/SLS_corrected_1.4.16.pdf)
