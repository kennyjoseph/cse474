## Intro stuff for class

I will cover content from some of these in the first two weeks of lecture, but these materials are handy if you want to brush up on the fundamentals.

This website also has a ton of phenomenal resources for learning python, probability, and statistics.

### Probability and Stats
- [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html)
- [Khan Academy open AP Stats Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)
- [CMU's ML course, math primer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/slides/10601-math-resources.pdf)

- [Introduction to Probability Textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/view)

### Linear Algebra
- [The matrix calculus you need for deep learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html)
- [Three Blue One Brown Course on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) 
- [The matrix cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)

### Python programming

- [DLab @ Berkeley's Computational Social Science](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program)

## Youtube

Two channels I have really enjoyed while preparing materials for this class:
- [The aforementioned 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
- [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

## Books

There is no required course textbook. However, I will at times suggest readings from  [Hal Daum√© III Course in Machine Learning Book](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-all.pdf).

And, some other (free online) books that you may find useful, and/or that we may refer to at some point in the class (oriented, given my expertise, to probabilistic/statistical perspectives):
- [Bayesian Data Analysis Third edition](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf)
- [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf)
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)
- [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)
- [Statistical Learning with Sparsity](https://hastie.su.domains/StatLearnSparsity_files/SLS_corrected_1.4.16.pdf)
- [Castella and Berger - Statistical Inference](https://mybiostats.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/casella-berger.pdf)
